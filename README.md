### Attention
Since my projects are open source, feel free to fork the project and make improvements! If you don't like my project, just go away!

Please DON'T contact me if you are newbie, I don't accept newbies anymore. Never ask me how to mod games, dump games, bypass security, hooking and patching, I'm not a teacher here.

I strongly advise you to avoid buying any source codes on Telegram. I will not be respnsibile for any sources from this repo sold on Telegram, and I don't care if paid sources are shared for free. All my sources here are FREE to use
