### Attention
I have to announce that development work on Mod menu including other projects has been temporary halted
The reason for this is that due to health and changes in my personal life, I simply do not want to work anymore. This is very frustrating for me but there is little I can really do about it. Please don't message me and disrespect my life, just because I cannot update

Since my projects are open source, feel free to fork the project and make improvements!

Please DON'T contact me if you are newbie, I don't accept newbies anymore. Never ask me how to mod games, dump games, bypass security, hooking and patching, i'm not a teacher here.

I strongly advise you to avoid buying any source codes on Telegram. I will not be respnsibile for any sources from this repo sold on Telegram, and I don't care if paid sources are shared for free. All my sources here are FREE to use

### NO MORE PUBG REPOS
Due to legal issues, all PUBG repos (even forked ones) are removed. But we are not responsible whoever reuploads removed repos, I suggest to not reupload them. Fuck PUBG addictive game anyways

We will not stop working with open source projects for modding.
