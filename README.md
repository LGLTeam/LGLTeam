### Attention
Since my projects are open source, feel free to fork the project and make improvements! If you don't like my project, just go away!

**FORKED PROJECTS ARE NOT MINE. ALL RIGHTS GO TO THE OWNER!**

Please DON'T contact me if you are newbie, I don't accept newbies anymore. Never ask me how to mod games, dump games, bypass security, hooking and patching, I'm not a teacher here.

Never ask when I will update something, I will never provide ETA (estimated time of arrival), no matter what!

I strongly advise you to avoid buying any source codes on Telegram. I will not be responsibile for any sources from this repo, sold on Telegram. All the sources hosted here are FREE to use! And, I don't care if any paid sources where shared for free in the Telegram enviornment, because, a) they are often expensive and b) 70~100% of changes you will get scammed regardless how much to trust them, so they deserve to be free üòù
